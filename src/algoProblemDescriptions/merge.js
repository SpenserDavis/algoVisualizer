      Write a function that takes in the heads of two Singly Linked Lists that
      are in sorted order, respectively. The function should merge the lists in
      place (i.e., it shouldn't create a brand new list) and return the head of
      the merged list; the merged list should be in sorted order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each LinkedList node has an integer 'value' as well as a 'next' node
      pointing to the next node in the list or to 'null' if it's the tail of the
      list.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may assume that the input linked lists will always have at least one
      node (i.e. the head will never be null).
    </p>
